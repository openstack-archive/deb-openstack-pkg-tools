.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pkgos-infra-install-sbuild

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B pkgos-infra-install-sbuild
installs a building environment using sbuild as a builder for the "gbp
buildpackage". The sbuild chroot uses an union FS as this is the fastest
backend, and that unionFS scratch disk is stored on tmpfs, as this is the
fastest way to run sbuild.

This script is used within the upstream OpenStack infra using a nodepool
and zuul deployment. It is not meant to be used by final users.
