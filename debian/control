Description: Tools and scripts for building Openstack packages in Debian
 This package contains some useful shell scripts and helpers for building the
 Openstack packages in Debian, including:
 .
  * shared code for maintainer scripts (.config, .postinst, ...).
  * init script templates to automatically generate init scripts for sysv-rc,
    systemd and upstart.
  * tools to build backports using sbuild and/or Jenkins based on gbp workflow.
  * utility to maintain git packaging (to be included in a debian/rules).
 .
 Even if this package is maintained in order to build OpenStack packages, it is
 of a general purpose, and it can be used for building any package.
